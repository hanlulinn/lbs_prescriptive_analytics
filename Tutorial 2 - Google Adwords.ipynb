    "**Google** is a popular search engine, and thus, it is a frequently used option for advertisers to place their ads. AdWords, the main advertising product of Google, was launched in 2000 to increase Google's revenue. Their opening pitch was \"Have a credit card and 5 minutes? Get you ad on Google\". Nowadays, AdWords allows advertisers to place bids for ganular search queries in order to display their ads on the search page. The original idea was invented by Bill Gross from Idealab. The similarities in the two systems led to some legal action, but the dispute was settled out of court, and AdWords continued unharmed. AdWords has been a very successful product for Google, which historically provided Google with over 90% of its annual revenue (2000-2014)."
