    "We will now formulate the diet problem as an optimization model. As discussed in class, there are three components:\n",
    "1. **Decision variables:** We create a decision variable $x_f$ for the quantity picked from each food item $f \\in {\\rm foods}$, meaning that we have the following decision variables: $x_{chicken}, x_{greens}, x_{salad},x_{bread}$. The quantity in the optimal diet is unknown; $x_f$ could potentially take any non-negative value.  The solver will find an optimal value $x^*_f$ for each food item $f$. For example, if the optimal diet does not contain any \"bread\", we will obtain $x^*_{bread} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constraints:** We need to guarantee a minimal daily intake for each nutrient. These requirements form an ensemble of *constraints*. For example, we need to ensure that at least 1800 calories are provided by the meal. Mathematically, this requirement is expressed using a linear constraint: \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$ 420 \\cdot x_{chicken} + 34\\cdot x_{greens} + 50\\cdot x_{salad} + 330\\cdot x_{bread} \\geq 1800$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this constraint, we multiply the quantity of each food item by the corresponding calorie contribution per unit. The total contribution should exceed the requirement of 1800. We will need one constraint for each nutrient: calories, protein and sodium.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Objective function:** Lastly, we need to select the objective function. *What should we optimize for?* The goal is find a menu composition that minimizes the total cost. The cost is given by the following expression:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$ 1.69 \\cdot x_{chicken} + 0.49\\cdot x_{greens} + 0.49\\cdot x_{salad} + 0.99\\cdot x_{bread}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We multiply the quantity of each food item by the corresponding cost per unit. The objective function is obtained by taking the sum."
